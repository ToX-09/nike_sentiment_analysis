review
These Nike shoes are very comfortable and stylish. Loved the design!
The quality is disappointing. Sole came off after a week.
Amazing performance shoes. Great grip and support during workouts.
Not worth the price. Looks good but not durable at all.
Perfect fit! Lightweight and very breathable. Highly recommend.
Too narrow and caused discomfort. Expected better from Nike.
I love the color and feel. Got lots of compliments!
"Shoes are okay, but delivery was delayed and the box was damaged."
Superb cushioning and perfect for running. Worth every penny.
Very poor build quality. Started tearing after two uses.
